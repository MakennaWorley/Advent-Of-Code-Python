# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the annual **Advent of Code** programming challenges.

## 2024
Solved all 25 Advent of Code problems using **Python**, applying a mix of:
- brute force
- heuristic search
- graph algorithms
- dynamic programming
- simulation

Solutions were chosen based on problem constraints and algorithmic complexity rather than a single fixed approach.  
For some of the more challenging problems, I referenced community discussions and other solution write-ups to better
understand advanced techniques and alternative strategies.
