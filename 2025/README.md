### 2025 Advent Of Code Overview

**In progress** Hoping to finish all 12 challenges before the holidays. For some of the harder
problems, I referenced community discussions or solution outlines to understand more advanced techniques

#### Brute Force
Exhaustively enumerate all possibilities where inputs are small and pruning is unnecessary.

Days: 2, 3 (part 1)

Techniques:
- 

Why used:

#### Heuristic / Guided Brute Force
Search-based solutions that reduce the brute-force space using heuristics, pruning, or randomness.

Days:

Techniques:
- 

Why used:

#### Graph Search / Shortest Path
Explicit graph traversal using BFS, Dijkstra, or augmented state graphs.

Days:

Techniques:
- 

Why used:

#### Dynamic Programming / Memoization
Avoid recomputation by caching overlapping subproblems.

Days:

Techniques:
- 

Why used:

#### Simulation / State Machines
Deterministic simulations where state evolves step-by-step.

Days: 1, 4

Techniques:
- 

Why used:

#### Greedy Algorithms
Make locally optimal decisions that lead to correct global results.

Days: 3 (part 2), 5

Techniques:
- 

Why used:

#### Parsing / Pattern Matching

Extract structured meaning from raw text inputs.

Days: 6

Techniques:
